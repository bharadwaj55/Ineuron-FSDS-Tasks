- Introduced in Terraform v0.14 and later.
- This basically can avoid outages due to version mismatches.

- Terraform remembers the version selected by storing in a dependency lock file. 
- Lock file currently tracks only the provider dependencies.

- If Terraform didnt find a lock file, it would download the latest provider versions.
- If you have lock file, lock file causes the Terraform to always to install the same provider version.
